# excel-file-uploader
This MVC 5 Application prompts the user to upload a Microsoft Excel file then parses the file by iterating through known colummns and n-rows. There is a sample model that assumes some basic 'User' information. It uses the Nuget package called EPPlus, which acts as a helper in parsing through the Excel workbook.
